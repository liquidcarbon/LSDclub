# The Plot

Imagine that you land on another planet.  It is a lot like Earth, it happens to be populated by people, they are mostly capable of understanding your language, and you can understand them.  The coolest thing about this planet is that people's survival and main societal needs are met in their sleep.  Though everyone's needs are different, over here they can afford to sleep at least as much as cats.  Some stay up more than others.  Some are hardly ever awake.  When they're up, they go outside, visit their favorite places, travel from one town to another, from one street corner to the next, and talk about their nights and dreams.  Ready for the plot twist?

Nobody's listening.

Though everyone has something to say, they're all talking at the same time.  Occasionally, someone climbs a tree and does something entertaining, or finds a mic and becomes louder than others, but the Great Cacophony never subsides.  It's a really interesting and weird place. 

So the Eartlings return home and vow to never come back, but that resolve never lasts.  They remain drawn to this other planet, because life on Earth, though infinitely beautiful, is very, VERY messy.


## The Idea

This metaphorical Other Planet is today's Internet, perhaps even the society as a whole.  It is currently suffering from AI-enabled, profit-driven enshittification.  Neither professional nor armchair disenshittificologists have any clue on what to do about it.

We need new ways to better balance consuming and producing information.  Like many other societal disbalances, the levels of information and attention asymmetries we've reached are unsustainable.

Here's one idea.  I'd like to create a platform that prioritizes and amplifies compassionate understanding over throwing shit around to see what sticks.

We need this to meet our need to be heard, to discover, convey, and accept what is true, and maybe, just maybe, as a side effect, we begin to wake up and fix this mess.


## The LSDclub

Let's start with a club.  Lowercase "c", not-a-big-deal community for exchanging original content and commentary on whatever you care about from the domains of Life, Science, and Data.  Broad enough to encompass many topics of interest, with a soft focus on life sciences, the factual data at its core, and ways to deal with this data.

In order to be able post anything, a community member first must issue two or more written responses to existing content, and the response itself must be deemed acceptable by a third party using reactions.

Meanwhile, it's 2 AM.  To be continued...
